It defines\n// all aspects of the block configuration and its interfaces, including `edit`\n// and `save`.

Blocks contained\n// within other blocks are called inner blocks. An important design\n// consideration is that inner blocks are -- conceptually -- not part of the\n// territory established by the parent block that contains them.\n//\n// This has multiple practical implications: when parsing, we can safely dispose\n// of any block boundary found within a block from the innerHTML property when\n// transfering to state. Not doing so would have a compounding effect on memory\n// and uncertainty over the source of truth. This can be illustrated in how,\n// given a tree of `n` nested blocks, the entry node would have to contain the\n// actual content of each block while each subsequent block node in the state\n// tree would replicate the entire chain `n-1`, meaning the extreme end node\n// would have been replicated `n` times as the tree is traversed and would\n// generate uncertainty as to which one is to hold the current value of the\n// block.

When this operation\n// fails -- for whatever reason -- the block is to be considered invalid. As\n// part of validating a block the system will attempt to run the source against\n// any provided deprecation definitions.\n//\n// Worth emphasizing that validation is not a case of whether the markup is\n// merely HTML spec-compliant but about how the editor knows to create such\n// markup and that its inability to create an identical result can be a strong\n// indicator of potential data loss (the invalidation is then a protective\n// measure).\n//\n// The invalidation process can also be deconstructed in phases: 1) validate the\n// block exists; 2) validate the source matches the output; 3) validate the\n// source matches deprecated outputs; 4) work through the significance of\n// differences. These are stacked in a way that favors performance and optimizes\n// for the majority of cases. That is to say, the evaluation logic can become\n// more sophisticated the further down it goes in the process as the cost is\n// accounted for. The first logic checks have to be extremely efficient since\n// they will be run for all valid and invalid blocks alike.

For example, all blocks can have a static and dynamic aspect\n// to them depending on the needs. The static nature of a block is the `save()`\n// definition that is meant to be serialized into HTML and which can be left\n// void. Any block can also register a `render_callback` on the server, which\n// makes its output dynamic either in part or in its totality.\n//\n// Child blocks are defined as a relationship that builds on top of the inner\n// blocks mechanism. A child block is a block node of a particular type that can\n// only exist within the inner block boundaries of a specific parent type. This\n// allows block authors to compose specific blocks that are not meant to be used\n// outside of a specified parent block context. Thus, child blocks extend the\n// concept of inner blocks to support a more direct relationship between sets of\n// blocks.
